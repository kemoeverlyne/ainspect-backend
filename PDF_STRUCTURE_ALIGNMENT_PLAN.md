# PDF Structure Alignment Plan

## Current vs. Template Structure

### Your Template Structure (`StandardReportPDFTemplate.tsx`)
```
Page 1: COVER PAGE
  - Company header (AInspect + AI logo)
  - Property address (large, prominent)
  - Property image (if available)
  - Meta grid (Client, Date, Report ID, Property Type, Year, Sq Ft)
  - Footer (Inspector, Realtor, Client cards)

Page 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
  - Section header: "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY"
  - Inspection Metrics (4 stat cards):
    * Overall Score
    * Total Issues  
    * Critical Issues
    * Safety Issues
  - Property Overview (table with all property data)
  - Report Conventions (4 colored boxes with definitions)

Page 3: SYSTEMS OVERVIEW
  - Section header: "SYSTEMS OVERVIEW"
  - Inspection Systems (TOC grid with colored tabs)
  - Systems Summary Table (with status, issues, completion %)

Pages 4+: Individual System Pages
  - One page per system
  - System status banner with completion bar
  - Stats cards (Issues, Critical, Attention, Good)
  - System summary
  - Detailed findings (grouped by category, sorted by priority)

Last Pages: Photo Documentation
  - Photo Gallery page (grid of all inspection photos)
  - Property Photo page (front home photo, if available)
```

### Backend Current Structure (`pdfGenerator.ts`)
```
Page 1: COVER PAGE ✅
  - Matches template structure
  - Company header with AI logo
  - Property details grid
  - Inspector/Realtor footer

Page 2: REPORT OVERVIEW ❌
  - Should be "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY"
  - Has "THE HOUSE IN PERSPECTIVE" ❌
  - Has "CONVENTIONS USED IN THIS REPORT" ✅
  - Has "BUILDING DATA" ❌ (should be in Executive Summary)
  - Missing "INSPECTION METRICS" dashboard ❌

Page 3: Table of Contents ❌
  - Has basic TOC but not in template style
  - Missing colored TOC grid
  - Missing Systems Summary table

Page 4: Executive Summary ❌
  - DUPLICATE - this is in wrong position
  - Should be page 2, not page 4
  - Missing inspection metrics dashboard

Pages 5+: Systems ✅
  - Structure is good but needs refinement

MISSING: Systems Overview page with TOC grid ❌
MISSING: Photo Gallery page ❌  
MISSING: Property Photo page ❌
```

3. Add Property Overview table
4. Update Report Conventions to colored boxes
5. Remove "THE HOUSE IN PERSPECTIVE" and "BUILDING DATA"

### Phase 2: Add Page 3 (Systems Overview) ✅  
1. Create dedicated "SYSTEMS OVERVIEW" page

   - System name + issue count + completion %
3. Add "Systems Summary" table with:
   - System name column
   - Status badge column
   - Issues count column

### Phase 3: Refine System Pages ✅
1. Ensure system status banner matches template
2. Add 4 stat cards (Issues, Critical, Attention, Good)
3. Group findings by category
4. Sort categories by priority (Critical → Attention → Good)
5. Color-code category headers

### Phase 4: Add Photo Pages ✅
1. Create Photo Gallery page (if photos exist)
2. Create Property Photo page (if frontHomePhoto exists)
3. Use template's photo grid styling

## Code Changes Required

### File: `ainspect-backend/server/services/pdfGenerator.ts`

**Lines to modify:**
- Line 782: Change "REPORT OVERVIEW" → "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY"
- Lines 784-842: Replace with template's Executive Summary structure
- Lines 844-909: Add new "SYSTEMS OVERVIEW" page
- Lines 910+: Keep existing but refine
- End: Add photo gallery and property photo pages

---

## CSS Updates Needed

Ensure these classes match template:

```css
/* Stat Cards - Executive Summary */
.stat-card {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f8fafc, #f1f5f9);
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 12px;
  border: 1px solid var(--border);
  text-align: center;
}

/* TOC Grid Items */
.toc-item {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 12px;
  padding: 14px 16px;
  background: white;
  border: 1px solid var(--border);
  border-radius: 10px;
  position: relative;
}

.toc-item::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 4px;
  background: var(--tab-color, var(--accent));
}

/* Info Table - Property Overview */
.info-table td:first-child {
  font-weight: 600;
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #f9fafb, #f3f4f6);
  width: 35%;
  color: #374151;
}
```

## Data Mapping Verification

Ensure these fields are populated:

### Executive Summary Metrics:
- `summary.overallScore` ✅ (alias added)
- `summary.totalIssues` ✅ (alias added)
- `summary.criticalIssues` ✅ (alias added)
- `summary.safetyIssues` ✅ (exists)

### Systems Data:
- `systems[key].name` ✅
- `systems[key].status` ✅
- `systems[key].issueCount` ✅
- `systems[key].completionPercentage` ✅
- `systems[key].items` ✅

### Photos:
- `reportData.photos[]` (need to verify)
- `reportData.frontHomePhoto` (need to verify)
