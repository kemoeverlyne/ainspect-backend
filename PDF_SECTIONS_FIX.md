# PDF Report - All Sections Documentation Fix

## Issue
The PDF reports were only showing data from `reportData.systems` but missing all other inspected sections that were stored in `reportData.sections`.

## Root Cause
The PDF generator was only iterating over `reportData.systems` and not checking for the more comprehensive `reportData.sections` object which contains all detailed inspection data organized by section.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Section Detection
Updated the Systems Overview section header condition to check for BOTH:
- `reportData.systems` (for structured system data)
- `reportData.sections` (for all other inspection sections)

```typescript
${(reportData?.systems && Object.keys(reportData.systems).length > 0) || 
  (reportData?.sections && Object.keys(reportData.sections).length > 0) ? `
```

### 2. Added Comprehensive Section Rendering
Added a new section renderer that processes ALL sections from `reportData.sections`:

```typescript
${reportData?.sections ? Object.entries(reportData.sections).map(([sectionId, sectionData]: [string, any]) => `
  // Render each section with all its items
`).join('') : ''}
```

### 3. Section Features
Each section now displays:
- **Section Title**: Automatically formatted from section ID or custom title
- **All Items**: Every item inspected within that section
- **Item Details**:
  - Title/Name
  - Condition/Rating with color coding
  - Value (if applicable)
  - Notes/Comments
  - Recommendations (highlighted in warning box)
  - Photos (up to 4 per item)
  
### 4. Color Coding
Items are color-coded based on condition:
- **Green**: Good/Satisfactory/Inspected
- **Yellow/Orange**: Attention/Marginal/Not Present  
- **Red**: Critical/Deficient/Failed

## Data Structure

The PDF now processes inspection data in this format:

```typescript
{
  reportData: {
    systems: {
      // Structured system data (e.g., HVAC, Electrical)
      electrical: { name, status, items... },
      plumbing: { name, status, items... }
    },
    sections: {
      // All other inspection sections
      roofing: {
        title: "Roofing System",
        shingles: {
          title: "Roof Shingles",
          condition: "good",
          notes: "...",
          photos: [...]
        },
        gutters: { ... }
      },
      foundation: {
        title: "Foundation",
        cracks: { ... },
        settlement: { ... }
      },
      // ... all other sections
    }
  }
}
```

## Impact

✅ **Complete Documentation**: PDF now includes ALL inspected areas, not just systems
✅ **Better Organization**: Sections are clearly labeled and grouped
✅ **Rich Details**: Notes, recommendations, and photos for each item
✅ **Visual Clarity**: Color-coded conditions for quick assessment
✅ **Flexible Structure**: Works with any section structure

## Example Sections Now Included

The PDF will now show ALL sections that were inspected, including but not limited to:
- Roofing System (shingles, flashing, gutters, ventilation)
- Foundation (cracks, settlement, drainage)
- Exterior (siding, trim, windows, doors)
- Interior (walls, ceilings, floors, stairs)
- Attic (insulation, ventilation, structure)
- Basement/Crawlspace (moisture, structure, access)
- Garage (door, floor, walls, ceiling)
- Grounds (grading, drainage, driveways, walkways)
- Kitchen (appliances, cabinets, counters, plumbing)
- Bathrooms (fixtures, ventilation, tile, plumbing)
- Bedrooms (windows, closets, outlets)
- Living Areas (fireplace, windows, doors)
- And ANY other custom sections added during inspection

## Before vs After

**Before**: Only showed 5-10 system categories (Electrical, Plumbing, HVAC, etc.)

**After**: Shows ALL 20+ inspection sections with complete details for every item inspected
